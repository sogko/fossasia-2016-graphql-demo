## What is this about?

I'll try to convince you that __GraphQL__ helps to address some of the more _common headaches_  developers faced when building a __REST API__ -backed application.

^ Also, at the end of the presentation, I'll reveal my true intentions. *sneaky*

^ Question:  Anyone who has tried building an application using REST?

# Let's start!

### Typical architecture of a web application using __REST API__

## Understanding common issues that developers face

### How?

^This is important to understand so that you see clearly how GraphQL would be beneficial to you.


---

## Let's try to design and build a REST application together!
### Yay!

^ We will use this as an example to illustrate common pain points when developing a real application using REST
^ Usually from experience, most of everyone here realize that getting from Point A to Point B when creating a product is not as straightforward as you hope it would be.
^ You always hope for the best and pray that things go your way..

### Goal: A newsfeed SPA

##### Mobile-first

#### REST API for data fetching

## Designing the REST API

Two __resources__
- Users
- Posts

```
POST /posts
GET /posts/1
PUT /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1
...
POST /users
GET /users/1
PUT /users/1
DELETE /users/1
...
```
Someone said: Let's achieve strict REST! We can do this!

---

# Let's see what happen

![left fit](/Users/hafiz/resources/FOSSASIA 2016/images/NEWSFEED.png)

### Render newsfeed
```
GET /posts?limit=10
{
  "posts": [
  	{
  		"id": 1,
  		"title": "Hello world!",
  		"author": 10,
  		"viewCount": 23,
  		"likedCount": 3,
  		"likedBy": [1, 3],
  	},
  	...
  ]
}

-
```
Great! 
Oh wait, we need to get `author's name` and `avatar URL`

---

![left fit](/Users/hafiz/resources/FOSSASIA 2016/images/NEWSFEED.png)

### Render newsfeed
```
GET /posts?limit=10
GET /users/10
{
  "user": {
		"id": 10,
  		"name": "John Doe",
  		"nickname": "Johnny",
  		"age": 23,
  		"avatar_url": "/avatar/10.jpg"
  	}
}

-
```
So we make another request to get the author for the first post...

---

### Render newsfeed
```
GET /posts?limit=10
GET /users/10
GET /users/20
{
  "user": {
		"id": 20,
  		"name": "Emily Sue",
  		"nickname": "M",
  		"age": 25,
  		"avatar_url": "/avatar/20.jpg"
  	}
}

```
Wait, so we have to do a separate request for each post to get information for its author?

# Issue #1: Multiple round trips
### This is no bueno

--- 

## Issue #1: Multiple round trips

One possible solution:
- A new endpoint `/newsfeed`

But now you have a singleton REST resource that is too tightly-coupled to your client UI. 

You then tell yourself "it's not that bad. We're still REST-ish."

Eventually, you launch your app with its mobile client and it went viral! Yay!

---

# New requirement!
## Here comes your product designer with changes

---
![left fit](/Users/hafiz/resources/FOSSASIA 2016/images/NEWSFEED - new requirement.png)
# New requirement!
- It has been a year since you first launch your mobile client, and you have several versions of the client out in the wild.
- Your product designer said: "We need to stop showing the `view_count` because of reasons"
- What do you do now?

---
![left fit](/Users/hafiz/resources/FOSSASIA 2016/images/NEWSFEED - new requirement.png)

- Removing the `view_count` field from `/newsfeed` is not an option.
- Older version of your mobile client depends on it. (What if they crash? #nilpointerreference)
- So newer version of the mobile client __does not need__ the `view_count` field, but to cater to the older versions, the `/newsfeed` still need to return it.

---
![left fit](/Users/hafiz/resources/FOSSASIA 2016/images/NEWSFEED - new requirement.png)

- __What if this keeps happening?__
Newer clients would be requesting data that they essentially don't need anymore.
- Not that bad when you just start out, but in the long run, it'll be something nagging at you 
- Sleepless nights are ahead for you.

---

# Issue #2: Overfetching of data


---

# Issue #2: Overfetching of data
Wouldn't it be nice if there client receives only the data that it requires and had requested?

One possible way to go about this:

- Endpoint accepts parameter to specify the fields that you are interested in

Not a bad solution, but _yet_ another thing to worry about.

# From a humble SPA to a full-fledge product
### You and your core team have build this complex API that serves a great purpose.
---

# From a humble SPA to a full-fledge product
- Your CEO recently announced that he envisions that your product should have a __client for every device / platform imaginable__.
- iOS, Android, OSX, Windows, Linux
- Raspberry Pis, BBC micro:bits
- Cars
- Your mom's toaster

----

# From a humble SPA to a full-fledge product
- New hires/developers join in.
- How do you quickly allow new developers to study your API
	- What resources are available,
	- What parameters are accepted
	- Which ones are required, which ones are not?

---

# From a humble SPA to a full-fledge product
- If only you had used Swagger / RAML / API Blueprint when you started.
- Now you have to invest time/effort into it.
- Or probably you already did, bonus points for you üëçüèª

---
## Issue #3: Documenting your API now becomes a thing.
---
## Issue #3: Documenting your API now becomes a thing.
- More than just writing down the specs in a formal form so that it can be referenced
- How you allow one to __discover__ and __explore__ your API?
- Big enough concern that some parts of the community has banded together to create tools for this. _(Which is a great thing, yay open-source)_
- But _yet_ another thing for you to worry about.

# Had enough?
### So how do we proceed from here?

---
## Here's where __GraphQL__ can help

---

# What is GraphQL?

---

# What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a __data query language and runtime__ designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps since 2012
<sup>Source: http://graphql.org</sup>

^ Not a GraphQL database
^ Think about it as a Data Fetching API

---

# What is GraphQL?

_What you need to know_: 
- A GraphQL __query is a string__ interpreted by a server that __returns data in a specified format.__

<sup>Which format? Anpther propriety format from FB aye?</sup>

---
# What is GraphQL?
  Here is an example query and its response:

## Wait, so how does __GraphQL__ address the issues previously raised?
### Does it even lift, bruh?

^ Instead of going into details the history, the specidication and all those boring details,
I'm going to show you exactly how it would help.
We'll take the same example REST application that we just "build" 
And see how GraphQL can help

## Recap of the issues

Issue #1: Multiple round trips.
Issue #2: Overfetching of data.
Issue #3: Documenting your API now becomes a thing.

# It's demo time! üòÑ
^You are not supposed to see this, I love smelling your hair.

# Review of demo
#### Hope nothing crashes

# Review of demo
- How to do a query 
	- `curl`
	- GraphiQL (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
	 	- Uses `introspection` queries to allow one to explore API

---

# Review of demo

- Addressed the issues that we had previously raisedough time 
	1. One query is all your probably need to render your UI fully
	2. Your clients would only get data that it is interested in.
	3. Built-in documentation and introspection as part as Schema definition.
